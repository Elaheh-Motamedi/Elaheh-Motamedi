# Hi, I’m Elaheh Motamedi 👋
PhD candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering focused on computer vision, multimodal learning (video/audio/WiFi), and robotics. I design robust Transformer‑based systems and deploy models for real‑time applications using CUDA/ONNX/TensorRT. I value clean, reproducible research and practical impact.

# About me
- 5+ years building and shipping ML/CV models on structured & unstructured data, including real-time deployment on edge devices
- **Published researcher** in top-tier venues including Nature Scientific Data and IEEE conferences
- **Competition winner**: 1st place at ACC 2023 self-driving car competition with custom YOLO system
- **Teaching experience**: Mentored 240+ students in FPGA and digital design as Graduate TA
- **Specialized in**: multimodal fusion, WiFi sensing, adversarial robustness, and model optimization for resource-constrained environments
- **Full-stack ML**: data pipelines → modeling → evaluation → deployment (achieved 2× speedup on Intel NCS2, 10× on NVIDIA Jetson)
