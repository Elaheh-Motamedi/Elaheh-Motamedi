# Hi, I’m Elaheh Motamedi 👋
PhD candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering focused on computer vision, multimodal learning (video/audio/WiFi), and robotics. I design robust Transformer‑based systems and deploy models for real‑time applications using CUDA/ONNX/TensorRT. I value clean, reproducible research and practical impact.

# About me

- 5+ years building and shipping ML/CV models on structured & unstructured data

- Strengths: multimodal fusion, event cameras, robustness (noise/missing modalities)

- Comfortable across the stack: data pipelines → modeling → evaluation → deployment

# Education

PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston (Expected:2026)
